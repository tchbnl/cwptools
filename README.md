I need to use CWP sometimes for work reasons. CWP is bad. It is bad and the CWP developers should feel bad. So here are some tools to make it a little easier to work with.

## Released
### docroot
Find the document root for domains on a CWP server

## In Development
### review
Show detailed information about a CWP account

### cwplogin
Like 'whmlogin' but for CWP (as much as possible)
